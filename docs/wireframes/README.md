# Wireframes — Kimberly

Low-fidelity wireframes (desktop + mobile) for the initial UI surface: Chat, Memory Manager, and Agents.

Files added:

- chat-desktop.svg — desktop chat screen showing conversation, composer, and the context/memory preview panel.
- chat-mobile.svg — mobile chat layout with composer and tappable context preview.
- memory-desktop.svg — desktop Memory Manager with filters, quota bar, list and detail panel.
- memory-mobile.svg — mobile Memory Manager with filter and row-centric list view.
- agents-desktop.svg — desktop Agents Dashboard showing agent cards, run preview, and logs.
- agents-mobile.svg — mobile Agents list and run preview.

How to view
-----------

Open the files in a browser or your editor preview pane. The SVGs are intentionally simple to be used as conversation starters for the next design steps.

Notes / next steps
------------------

- Annotated flows for each screen (short text annotations) — included below.
- Create hi-fidelity mockups for approved layouts (Figma or static HTML/CSS).
- Add accessibility checks and detailed copy for microcopy/confirmations.

Annotations
-----------

Chat screen notes

- Composer should include an explicit "Save to memory" control and show the last meditation run timestamp.
- Right rail context preview must show 'why' a memory item was included and provide quick remove/protect controls.

Memory Manager notes

- Show a visual quota bar with clear thresholds and actions for when limits are approached/exceeded.
- Memory detail must include audit history and consent flags for sensitive items.

Agents Dashboard notes

- Agents need a clear sandbox toggle and an explicit summary of memory reads/writes before the final commit.
- Run history should be available with re-run or revert actions for admin/power-users.
