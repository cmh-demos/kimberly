# Branding Guidelines for Kimberly

## Overview

Kimberly's brand embodies intelligence, reliability, and personalization, inspired by
Jarvis from Iron Man. As a personal AI assistant, the branding focuses on trust,
innovation, and user-centric design.

## Color Palette

Based on your preference for purple, we've developed a cohesive palette that conveys
creativity, sophistication, and approachability:

- **Primary Color: Deep Purple** (#6A0DAD) - For headers, buttons, and key UI elements.
  Represents intelligence and mystery.
- **Secondary Color: Lavender** (#E6E6FA) - For backgrounds and subtle accents. Adds a
  soft, calming feel.
- **Accent Color: Electric Indigo** (#4B0082) - For highlights, links, and active
  states. Provides energy and focus.
- **Neutral Colors**:
  - Light Grey (#F5F5F5) - For backgrounds and text.
  - Dark Grey (#333333) - For body text and borders.
- **Success/Error Colors**: Standard green (#28A745) and red (#DC3545) for feedback.

This palette ensures accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliant) and works across platforms (web,
mobile, voice interfaces).
