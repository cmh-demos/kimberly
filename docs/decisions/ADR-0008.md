# ADR-0008: Web-first MVP with Progressive Mobile Support

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Kimberly requires a platform strategy that balances development velocity, user
experience, and resource constraints. The key question is whether the MVP
should target web-only or launch with simultaneous web + mobile (native or
PWA) and voice support.

Key considerations:

- **Layout decisions**: Different platforms require different UI patterns
- **Interaction patterns**: Touch, mouse, keyboard, and voice have distinct UX
- **Development resources**: Single-user project with limited capacity
- **MVP timeline**: Q1 2026 target release

## Decision

Adopt a **web-first** approach for the MVP with progressive mobile support:

### MVP (Q1 2026): Web-first

- Primary target: Modern web browsers (desktop and mobile-responsive)
- Responsive design from day one (mobile-friendly layouts already in wireframes)
- PWA-ready architecture (service worker, manifest, offline-capable structure)
- Voice input via Web Speech API (browser-native, no separate voice platform)

### Post-MVP: Progressive enhancement

- Phase 1: PWA deployment for mobile (installable, offline support)
- Phase 2: Native mobile apps if PWA limitations are identified
- Phase 3: Dedicated voice assistant integrations (smart speakers)

## Rationale

### Why web-first for MVP

1. **Faster iteration**: Single codebase, instant deployment, no app store
   review cycles
2. **Lower complexity**: One set of layout decisions and interaction patterns
   to perfect before expanding
3. **PWA provides mobile reach**: Modern PWAs offer near-native experience
   with push notifications, offline support, and home screen installation
4. **Voice through web**: Web Speech API provides text-to-speech (TTS) and
   automatic speech recognition (ASR) without separate infrastructure

### Why not native mobile for MVP

1. **Duplicated effort**: Maintaining iOS, Android, and web triples development
   and testing burden
2. **App store friction**: Review processes slow iteration during early
   development
3. **Limited differentiation**: Single-user system doesn't need native device
   integrations (contacts, SMS) that justify native apps

### Why not dedicated voice platform for MVP

1. **Certification overhead**: Alexa Skills, Google Actions require separate
   certification processes
2. **Limited control**: Platform policies may conflict with privacy-first
   approach
3. **Web Speech is sufficient**: Browser-based voice input/output meets MVP
   requirements

## Consequences

### Pros

- Faster time-to-market for MVP
- Single codebase reduces maintenance burden
- Mobile-responsive design ensures usability on phones/tablets
- PWA path provides clear mobile upgrade without starting over

### Cons

- Web Speech API has browser compatibility limitations
- PWA may not access all native device features (background processing limits)
- Users expecting native apps may perceive quality difference

### Risks and mitigations

- **Risk**: PWA limitations block critical features
  - **Mitigation**: Design architecture to support future native wrapper
    (Capacitor/Tauri) if needed
- **Risk**: Web Speech API inadequate for voice UX
  - **Mitigation**: Abstract voice interface to allow pluggable TTS/ASR
    providers

## Implementation notes

- Wireframes already include mobile layouts (chat-mobile.svg, etc.)
- UI_DESIGN.md confirms "web-first" as the baseline approach
- Ensure all UI components are touch-friendly and responsive
- Implement PWA manifest and service worker skeleton in MVP architecture
