# ADR-0001: Project architecture approach

Status: Accepted

Decision: Use modular service-based architecture.

Context: To enable independent scaling, easier testing, team ownership of services, and
fault isolation.

Consequences: Increases complexity in deployment and inter-service communication, but
improves maintainability and scalability.
