# ADR-0005: Prefer Open Source Software

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Kimberly should prioritize open source software for components, libraries, and integrations to ensure transparency, community support, and reduced vendor lock-in.

## Decision

- Use open source alternatives where available and suitable (e.g., PostgreSQL over proprietary DBs, Kubernetes over proprietary orchestration).
- Exceptions only if open source lacks critical features or performance, with justification.
- Evaluate licenses for compatibility (e.g., prefer MIT/Apache over GPL if needed).

## Consequences

- Pros: Cost-effective, auditable, community-driven improvements.
- Cons: Potential maintenance burden if community support wanes; may require more customization.
