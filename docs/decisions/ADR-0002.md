# ADR-0002: Data storage choice

Status: Proposed

Decision: Use PostgreSQL for primary relational data and Redis for short-lived caching.

Context: We need strong relational guarantees, ACID transactions, and mature migration
tools.

Consequences: Operational cost for managed DB, backup and migration plans required;
Redis introduces TTL semantics and cache invalidation considerations.
