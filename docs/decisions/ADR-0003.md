# ADR-0003: API style

Status: Proposed

Decision: Offer a RESTful JSON API for external integrations; support GraphQL for
internal aggregation endpoints where beneficial.

Context: REST is widely compatible; GraphQL can reduce chatty requests for complex UIs.

Consequences: Two API surfaces to document and secure; increased testing and monitoring
surface area.
