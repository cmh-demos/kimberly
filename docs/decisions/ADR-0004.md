# ADR-0004: Deployment model

Status: Accepted

Decision: Containerized microservices deployed to Kubernetes; infrastructure managed with Terraform.

Context: We need scalability, service isolation, and declarative infra for automated provisioning and high availability.

Consequences: Requires K8s operational expertise, CI/CD pipelines, and robust observability; adds overhead but enables reliable scaling.

## Addendum — bootstrap & migration guidance

To help projects get running quickly without full managed Kubernetes onboarding, we recommend two bootstrap choices:

- Oracle Cloud Always Free (self-managed): suitable for low-cost full-control environments where you can run k3s/k0s on free VMs.
- Fly.io (managed): fast, minimal infra for early-stage deployments where operating a full K8s cluster is unnecessary.

Container registry

Prefer an external, provider-agnostic registry such as GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`) for initial image hosting to simplify migration between providers.

Migration guardrails

- Keep IaC and manifests portable: avoid provider-specific resources in early modules and use S3-compatible storage, standard Postgres, and Redis patterns.
- When adding a second provider for cross-cloud failover, create provider-specific terraform modules and a synchronization plan for stateful services.
