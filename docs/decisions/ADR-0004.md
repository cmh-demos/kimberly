# ADR-0004: Deployment model

Status: Accepted

Decision: Containerized microservices deployed to Kubernetes; infrastructure managed with Terraform.

Context: We need scalability, service isolation, and declarative infra for automated provisioning and high availability.

Consequences: Requires K8s operational expertise, CI/CD pipelines, and robust observability; adds overhead but enables reliable scaling.
