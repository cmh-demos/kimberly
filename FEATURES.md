## Overview
Kimberly is a personal AI assistant inspired by Jarvis from Iron Man, designed for conversational interaction across multiple platforms. It features advanced memory management and agent delegation for seamless task handling.

## Core Features

### Conversational Interface
- Natural language chat with voice, web, and mobile support.
- Multi-platform availability: Voice (e.g., smart speakers), Web (browser-based), Mobile (iOS/Android apps).
- Real-time responses with context awareness.

### Memory Management
- **Short-term Memory**: Max 5MB, wiped daily during "sleep" with prioritization (recency, importance, frequency).
- **Long-term Memory**: Max 25MB, wiped daily based on 1-week retention.
- **Permanent Memory**: Max 500MB, with automatic rotation via "meditation" process.
- **Meditation**: Nightly grading of memories using a weighted score (40% relevance to goals, 30% emotional weight, 20% predictive usefulness, 10% recency/frequency). Memories below threshold are forgotten.

### Agent Delegation

  - **Scheduler**: Manages calendar, reminders, and task planning (integrates with external calendars).
  - **Researcher**: Handles web searches, data gathering, and summarization.
  - **Coder**: Assists with code writing, debugging, and automation.
  - **Reminder**: Tracks follow-ups, deadlines, and notifications.
- Limits: Max 3 concurrent agents, resource-capped to prevent overload.
- Agents report back to Kimberly for user summaries.

## Future Enhancements
