do not:
- work on the main branch
- work outside of project directory

rules:
- responses should be less than 100 words
- queue Q&A; keep questions until answered
- further considerations are added to the Q&A queue
- all work pushed to git
- auto-log timestamps and append to copilot_tracking.json after each request
- commit change after each request
- use precise durations during logging activities

allow:
- auto-update-logs: true
- auto-edit-paths:
  - "misc/*"
  - "docs/*"
- exclude-branches:
  - "main"

logging:
- path: "./misc/copilot_tracking.json"
- fields:
  - request_start_time
  - request_end_time
  - processing_time_microseconds
  - tokens_used
  - tokens_used_estimate
  - tool_calls_count
  - files_accessed_count
  - terminal_commands_count
- request_handling_order:
  - record_start_timestamp
  - handle_request
  - estimate tokens
  - record_end_timestamp
  - report_response

GIT pattern: <type>/<scope-or-ticket>-short-desc (use hyphens). Types: feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, ci, test, hotfix, wip. Examples: docs/project-definition, feat/PROJ-12-auth, chore/setup-ci, fix/login-null, refactor/api-client. Use ticket IDs when available. Keep branches off main and open PRs from feature branches.
