# Roadmap

Milestones and releases:
- MVP: Basic conversational chat, memory management, and simple coding problem solving.
- v1: Long-term memory, basic agent delegation, and expanded coding capabilities.

Timeline: Q1 2026 for MVP release.

## Detailed Roadmap
- Q4 2025: Prototype core chat and memory.
- Q1 2026: MVP release with basic agents.
- Q2 2026: v1 with advanced features.
- Q3 2026: Beta testing and refinements.
- Q4 2026: Full launch.

## Risks
- AI model availability: Mitigate by selecting stable open-source models (e.g., Llama) with fallbacks; monitor community updates and plan for model upgrades.
- Scalability challenges: Mitigate with Kubernetes auto-scaling, load testing, and performance profiling; cap initial user load.
- User adoption: Mitigate through beta testing feedback, iterative improvements, and clear documentation; focus on single-user personalization.
