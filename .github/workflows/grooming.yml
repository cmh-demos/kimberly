    # Limit the GITHUB_TOKEN to the least privilege needed by the
    # grooming script. It reads repo contents locally (checkout) and
    # needs write access to issues and projects to modify and move
    # items on the board. All other scopes are implicitly set to none.

      # Note: 'projects' isn't currently a valid workflow permissions
      # key in the Actions schema used by this repository's tooling.
      # If the grooming runner needs to move project cards at runtime
      # you have two options:
      # 1) Use a repository/organization default that allows project
      #    operations for GITHUB_TOKEN, or
      # 2) Provide a fine-grained PAT or GitHub App token (stored in
      #    secrets) with the "Projects" permission and use that token
      #    instead of GITHUB_TOKEN when calling project endpoints.
