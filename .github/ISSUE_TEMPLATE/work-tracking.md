**Guidelines for Using This Template:**

- **Assignment**: Every issue must be assigned to someone from the roles defined in `roles.md`.
  If unsure, assign to the most relevant role (e.g., Backend Developer for API tasks).
- **Time Tracking**: Provide an estimate at creation. When the issue is resolved, update the "Actual
  Time Spent" field in the issue description or comments for tracking purposes.
- **Labels**: Use appropriate labels (e.g., "bug", "feature", "backend") in addition to "work-
  tracking" (see .github/labels.yml for full list of standard labels).
- **Closing**: Ensure acceptance criteria are met before closing. Update actual time and any
  retrospective notes.
