# Project: Kimberly

## Vision
Kimberly is a personal AI assistant inspired by Jarvis from Iron Man, designed to be a versatile helper that can handle a wide range of tasks through conversational interaction, advanced memory management, and agent delegation. It solves the problem of users needing a single, intelligent interface for productivity, personalization, and task automation across platforms, where current assistants lack depth, memory, or seamless integration.
