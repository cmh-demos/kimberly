# Project: Kimberly

## Vision
Kimberly is a personal AI assistant inspired by Jarvis from Iron Man, designed to be a versatile helper that can handle a wide range of tasks through conversational interaction, advanced memory management, and agent delegation. It solves the problem of needing a single, intelligent interface for productivity, personalization, and task automation across platforms, where current assistants lack depth, memory, or seamless integration. Target user: The developer/owner (me), seeking a customized AI companion.

## Personas
- Primary user: The developer/owner, a tech-savvy individual building and using Kimberly for personal productivity and experimentation.
- Secondary user: None (single-user system).

## Goals
- Short-term (MVP): Implement basic conversational chat, memory management (short-term with prioritization), and the ability to solve simple coding problems.
- Long-term: Full agent delegation with advanced learning capabilities.

## Non-goals
- Out-of-scope items to avoid.
